# Gemini CLI Instructions

This file provides guidance to Gemini CLI when working with this codebase.

**Primary Instructions:** See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for complete project guidelines.

All AI coding assistants in this project use CLAUDE.md as the single source of truth for:
- Project context and overview
- Git interaction policies
- Code style guidelines
- Security requirements
- Testing approach
- Architecture documentation

## Why CLAUDE.md?

Smart Assets maintains vendor-neutral documentation. CLAUDE.md serves as the canonical reference because:
1. It was the first comprehensive AI assistant guidance format adopted
2. All other AI assistant files (AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md) reference it
3. This prevents documentation drift across multiple files

## Gemini-Specific Notes

If Gemini CLI has specific capabilities or limitations that differ from other assistants, document them below:
