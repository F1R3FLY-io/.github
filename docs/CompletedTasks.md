1. Copy the entire epoch block (YAML frontmatter + context)
2. Update `status: complete`
3. Add `completed_at`, `completed_by`, and optionally `mr_pr`
4. Update all task statuses to `complete` with `completed_at` dates
5. Add a brief **Summary** section
6. Optionally add **Key Changes** and **Lessons Learned**
