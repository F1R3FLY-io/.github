## Template Usage Notes

This template is used by `scripts/generate-monthly-report.sh` to create monthly status reports.

### Narrative Sections

Sections marked with `<!-- AI_NARRATIVE_START: section_name -->` are placeholders for human or AI-generated narrative content. The `/github-activity-report` Claude Code command can help fill these in.

### Customization

- Add or remove repository sections as needed
- Adjust category groupings in `scripts/lib/github-report-integration.sh`
- Modify metrics displayed in the formatting library

### Automation

The script can be run manually or scheduled via cron:

```bash
# Generate report for previous month
./scripts/generate-monthly-report.sh

# Generate report for specific month
./scripts/generate-monthly-report.sh --month 2025-01

# Dry run (preview without writing)
./scripts/generate-monthly-report.sh --dry-run
```
